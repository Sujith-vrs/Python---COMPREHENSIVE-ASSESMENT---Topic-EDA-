# Python---COMPREHENSIVE-ASSESMENT---Topic-EDA-
1. Importing Libraries:
* pandas is imported as pd: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
* numpy is imported as np: Useful for numerical operations.
* matplotlib.pyplot is imported as plt: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
* seaborn is imported as sns: A statistical data visualization library based on matplotlib.
2. Loading the Dataset:
* file_path is a string variable holding the path to the CSV file.
* data = pd.read_csv(file_path) loads the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame called data. 
  This DataFrame is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types, similar to an Excel spreadsheet or a SQL table.
* data.head() displays the first five rows of the DataFrame.
  This is useful to get an initial understanding of the structure of the dataset, such as the column names, data types, and a preview of the data.
3. Counting the Values in the 'Team' Column:
* data['Team'].value_counts(): This counts the number of occurrences of each unique value in the 'Team' column of the DataFrame.
* reset_index(): This resets the index of the resulting Series to convert it back to a DataFrame. The original index becomes a column, and a new default integer index is created.
  This line renames the columns of the team_distribution DataFrame to 'Team' and 'count'. 
* After value_counts(), the resulting DataFrame has default column names, and this step gives meaningful names to those columns.
* team_distribution['count'].sum(): This calculates the sum of the 'count' column, which represents the total number of employees across all teams.
4. Calculating the Percentage for Each Team:
  team_distribution['count'] / total_employees: This calculates the fraction of the total employees for each team.
  This converts the fraction to a percentage.
* The result is stored in a new column 'percentage' in the team_distribution DataFrame.
  This line prints the team_distribution DataFrame to the console, showing the team names, the count of employees in each team, and the percentage of the total employees that each team 
  represents.
5. Counting the Values in the 'Position' Column:
  data['Position'].value_counts(): This counts the number of occurrences of each unique value in the 'Position' column of the DataFrame.
* reset_index(): This resets the index of the resulting Series to convert it back to a DataFrame. The original index becomes a column, and a new default integer index is created.
6. Renaming Columns:
  This line renames the columns of the position_distribution DataFrame to 'Position' and 'Count'.
* After value_counts(), the resulting DataFrame has default column names, and this step gives meaningful names to those columns.
7. Calculating the Total Number of Employees:
* position_distribution['Count'].sum(): This calculates the sum of the 'Count' column, which represents the total number of employees across all positions.
8. Calculating the Percentage for Each Position:
* position_distribution['Count'] / total_employees: This calculates the fraction of the total employees for each position.
  This converts the fraction to a percentage.
  The result is stored in a new column 'Percentage' in the position_distribution DataFrame.
9. Printing the position_distribution DataFrame:
  This line prints the position_distribution DataFrame to the console.
* It will display the 'Position', 'Count', and 'Percentage' columns, showing the distribution of employees across different positions, the number of employees in each position, and the 
  percentage of the total employees that each position represents.
10. Saving the position_distribution DataFrame to a CSV File:
* position_distribution.to_csv('C:/Users/LENOVO/Downloads/position_distribution.csv', index=False): This line saves the position_distribution DataFrame to a CSV file at the specified path.
 'C:/Users/LENOVO/Downloads/position_distribution.csv': The file path where the CSV file will be saved.
11. index=False: This parameter ensures that the DataFrame index is not included in the CSV file. Only the columns 'Position', 'Count', and 'Percentage' will be saved.
12. Printing the position_distribution DataFrame Again
* This line prints the position_distribution DataFrame to the console again.
* This is redundant since the DataFrame hasn't changed after being saved to the CSV file, but it serves to display the same information once more.
* Identify the predominant age group among employees.
* Counting the Values in the 'Age Group' Column.
13. Renaming Columns:
 This line renames the columns of the age_group_distribution DataFrame to 'Age Group' and 'Count'. After value_counts(), the resulting DataFrame has default column names, and this step 
* gives meaningful names to those columns.
14. Finding the Predominant Age Group:
* age_group_distribution['Count'].idxmax(): This function returns the index of the row with the maximum value in the 'Count' column. In other words, it identifies the age group that has 
  the highest count of employees.
* age_group_distribution.loc[...]: This part selects the row at the index identified by idxmax(), extracting the row corresponding to the predominant age group.
15. predominant_age_group: This variable holds the DataFrame row of the age group with the highest number of employees.
* Printing the Age Group Distribution.
* Printing the Predominant Age Group.
16. Checking if Columns Exist:
*  This line checks if the columns 'Team', 'Position', and 'Salary' are all present in the data DataFrame. The issubset method is used to determine if the set {'Team', 'Position', 
  'Salary'} is a subset of data.columns.
17. Calculating Salary Expenditure:
*  data.groupby(['Team', 'Position']): This groups the DataFrame by the 'Team' and 'Position' columns.
* ['Salary'].sum(): For each group, this calculates the sum of the 'Salary' column.
* reset_index(): This resets the index of the resulting Series to convert it back to a DataFrame.
* Renaming Columns.
18. Finding the Team and Position with the Highest Salary Expenditure.
19. Printing the Salary Expenditure by Team and Position.
20. Printing the Team and Position with the Highest Salary Expenditure.
21. Investigate if there's any correlation between age and salary, and represent it visually.
22. For each of the five analysis tasks, create appropriate visualizations.
